                <p>Yeah, you listened, but did you really cared to notice the little things, the details? No, you didnt.
                    You just wanted the big picture so much than you didnt even bother to see all the little
                    masterpieces i have painted for you. You’ve been talking about the perfect thing, the best for you,
                    and how i didnt give that. You wanted something from the museum, but you didnt want to pay for it.
                    Thats why you trow away my Van Gogh in the trash, and settled for a painting from Jarry down the
                    block. Didnt know about the value of deatails, just the size of the picture, that’s why i became
                    part of trash. But, no worry, i still can sell my piece for something like a coffee or a pint of
                    beer or even more to those who know it’s purety. Another mans trash is ones treasure, and you missed
                    out on a gold mine, love. Be seeing you in the gallery, where i will be hanging like something you
                    needed, and you walking like you don’t notice all of that, like its not everything you hope for, but
                    now only having the luxury of renting it.
